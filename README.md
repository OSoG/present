We can put images 2 ways;

one, we can use markdown syntax

two, we can use html.

I will focus on markdown syntax

`![](path/to/your/image)`

This will do.

Using absolute path is not a good idea.

I have created a folder named `images` in my repo

Then I will write

`![](images/2018-12-29_08-56-07.png)`

This is the result :

![](images/2018-12-29_08-56-07.png)
